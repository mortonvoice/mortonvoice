                    If you’ve seen me in the hallways (You probably haven’t, I know you don’t pay attention to people besides your
                    friends) you’ll see that chances are I’m wearing a sweatshirt. You’re probably thinking “Oh man, this guy is just
                    gonna talk about sweatshirts, I should go to the comic section.” If you wanna ditch this article, email your friends
                    to not read it, and delete this from your search history, go ahead. I really can’t stop you, I’m a news article. But
                    if you stay, you can learn about the world of sweatshirts.
                    <br> <br>
                    For one, sweatshirts are really insulating. I can be fine in sub -40 degree weather in one of these. My friends will
                    be freezing, but I’ll be fine; you can also look decent in them! (If you know what to wear with it.) In fact, I wear
                    a sweatshirt everyday and I don’t get made fun of, I think. So if you see a sweatshirt at the store or the mall or
                    wherever you go, at this point in life, consider this article.
                    <br> <br>
                    If you made it this far, congratulations! You got to sit through me lecturing you about sweatshirts! Also, feel free
                    to send your friends what you thought about this article on social media! Chances are, it won’t be too good for
                    publicity, but I can live with that.
                    <br> <br>
                    You can go now.

                    <h3 class="article-author">Lily Gleiberman</h3>
                </div>
                <p class="article-body">
                    There’s a lot of bad films out there. Sometimes, people try to disguise a bad movie’s reputation with its iconicness and
                    flair. With that, I’ve learned to never let the label “popular movie” make me watch 6 hours of a sci-fi space drama with
                    no plot whatsoever. That’s not talking about any movie in pirticularrrrrrr…… But, I feel people think a movie is
                    automatically horrible if it lacks something called sanity or plot development or consistency. Let me just get to the
                    point: there are bad-bad movies and good-bad movies. Some examples of bad-bad movies are Cats (2019) and Fantastic
                    Beasts And Where To Find Them (2016). These bad-bad movies lack a lot of things, but mainly entertainment. They’re just
                    all round bad, and there isn’t even a comedic part of why it's so bad. There’s nothing to poke fun at. There’s nothing
                    to look at from a different angle. A good movie should be open to interpretation. A movie with an infinite number of
                    angles is so much more powerful than a movie without. That’s why good-bad movies aren’t as bad as people think.
                    Throughout their crazy madness, one could view that movie in more shades of light than a movie that’s seen as good. One
                    could think that the movie was purposely made bad in a way of satire. Good-bad movies are films you can have a fun time
                    watching. In this top 3 list, I will be talking about good-bad movies. <br> <br>

                    1. <em>Cinderella (2021)</em> - Including Camilla Cabeo, James Corden, Billy Porter, and Idina Menzel, this movie was reaching
                    FAR too “feminist” and empowering for me. If you’re into good plot lines being ignored, bad plot lines being shoved in
                    your face, sloppy character development, hilarious (NOT) jokes, and James Cordon playing the gay comedic relief for the
                    50th time, this movie is for you! But, seriously, I enjoyed this movie for how fun it was to poke fun at. I hope Janet
                    Jackson’s bank account got its due for the opening number of Rhythm Nation. <br> <br>

                    2. <em>Annie (1982)</em> - You can sit through this movie at the beginning, but you’ll point your finger once you get deep into
                    the movie. This movie gets so drastic and dramatic, it doesn’t seem rude to laugh at it. Which writer added the scene
                    where Annie gets chased up a drawbridge after a car chase in an escape of murder from a greedy Jim Curry in a mustache?
                    Miss Hannigan, I’ve a feeling we’re not in the orphanage anymore. <br> <br>

                    3. <em>LIVE ACTION Mulan (2020)</em> - The animated film Mulan is a masterpiece, so my expectations were high for this movie—- I
                    hated this movie. I hated it. I hated it. This movie is my 14th reason why I’m gonna burn my tv screen. It’s movies like
                    this that make me truly scared for the film industry. I’m getting depressed just thinking about it. Not only was the
                    storyline lacking so much consistency and structure from the animated film, but they added all this granola about a
                    powerful goddess turning into a phoenix. The thing that made my blood boil was when they introduced Mulan as a ten year
                    old girl, ALREADY WANTING to be a warrior. The whole point of Mulan is that even though she’s just taking her father’s
                    place, she discovers herself and how strong she can be at fighting. That’s her development in the story. With this
                    movie, all we see is Mulan throwing sticks and talking to a guardian phoenix who is evil. The writers of this movie are
                    evil. To think, the potential there was to make an absolutely terrific movie. The seven-minute film I made with my
                    friends on CapCut was 50 times better than this. I beg of you to watch this movie. Revel in how it’s so horrible, it’s
                    funny.

                    <h3 class="article-author">Henry Rhind</h3>
                </div>
                <p class="article-body">
                    On a warm sunny day, in the small town of East Hampton, a group of boys, known as the Green Boys, ruled the hill on
                    Leighton Lane. They were known for being relatively peaceful as long as you did not threaten them. They would
                    usually fight on rare occasions because they have never lost a battle. <br>
                    One day the pathfinder cits who where usually hanging about the 7/11 in Montauk having game of mini golf or doing
                    their tasks at the camp. One day a green boy who had come to the 7/11 to get some candy got his foot run over by a
                    cit and had to go to the doctor. I was on the cits by the time this happened, but soon after we received a letter of
                    war, so we decided to make weapons of war; the rules were if you got hit, you had to play dead and you could only
                    use non- lethal weapons. Whoever wins will meet the other teams agreements. <br>
                    On a warm breezy weekend day, we made our move. We used nerf guns and paintball guns. We had many troops willing to
                    take the trip, but we were outnumbered. When the day of the battle came, we did not have the strength in numbers. We
                    had the strength in mind. We used our money to buy all the paintball and nerf guns in the area, so the Green Boys
                    were under supplied. <br>
                    We made the first move by attacking East Hampton Hill. On the day, we were confident. However the Green Boys had put
                    up defenses and were using tennis ball shooters as machine guns, but we fought hard. Many of us were down but we
                    used everything we got to beat the Green Boys. In the end, we were surrounding them and taking the hill. If you knew
                    what happened, you would be shocked to find out that the Green Boys had fallen and that the cits of a small but well
                    known camp in Montauk had won. All I can say from that experience is that I may walk alone to school and back but in
                    the end, in my heart I will never walk alone.

                    I am temporary. <br>
                    I am not the girl that <br>
                    does. <br>
                    I am the girl that <br>
                    wishes. <br>
                    I am the girl that wishes <br>
                    rocks and waterfalls were pretty. <br>
                    I am the girl that wishes <br>
                    clouds and cold were inviting. <br>
                    I am the girl that wishes <br>
                    cluttered closets could be cleaned. <br>
                    I am the girl that wishes <br>
                    a shoulder was enough. <br>
